# Typing Speed Test Application

Project Description
The Typing Speed Test App is a web-based application designed to help users evaluate their typing speed and accuracy. By displaying a paragraph and running a 30-second timer, the app provides an engaging way to measure words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage at the end of each session.

Features
Start Button – Initiates the test, starts the timer, and displays the paragraph.

Timer Functionality – Updates every second and stops after 30 seconds.

Typing Speed & Accuracy Calculation – Determines WPM based on correctly typed words and calculates accuracy percentage.

Result Display – Shows detailed performance stats when the timer ends.

Retry Button – Allows users to reset the test and try again.

How It Works
Start Test – Click the Start Test button to begin.

Typing Session – Type the provided paragraph while the timer runs.

Test Completion – When time is up, the app displays the test results.

Retry Option – Click Retry Test to reset everything and take the test again.

Calculation Methods
Typing Speed (WPM) = (Correctly typed words / Time taken) × 60

Accuracy (%) = (Correctly typed characters / Total characters) × 100

Technologies Used
React (JSX) – For dynamic UI updates.

HTML & CSS – Used for the app's structure and styling.
