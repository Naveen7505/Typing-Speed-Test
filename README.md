# Typing Speed Test Application

Project Description
This project is a typing speed test application that helps users measure their typing speed and accuracy. The app displays a paragraph and runs a 30-second timer while the user types. At the end of the test, the app calculates words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage to show the user's performance.


Key Features:
Start Button: Clicking it enables typing, starts the timer, displays the paragraph, and disables the start button.

Timer Functionality: The timer updates every second and stops after 30 seconds.

Typing Speed & Accuracy Calculation: The app calculates speed (WPM) and accuracy percentage based on typed words and characters.

Result Display: Once the timer ends, a result section appears, showing speed, accuracy, and a retry button.

Retry Button: Clicking "Retry Test" resets everything—reactivating the start button, clearing the input field, and restoring the timer to 30 seconds.

How It Works:
Start Test: The user clicks the start button, enabling typing and starting the timer.

Typing Session: The user types for 30 seconds while the app tracks speed and accuracy.

Test Completion: When time is up, the app displays the result section.

Retry Option: The user can restart the test anytime.

Calculation Methods:
Typing Speed: (Correctly typed words / time taken) × 60

Accuracy: (Correctly typed characters / total characters) × 100

This project provides a fun way to practice typing, improve speed, and enhance accuracy while tracking progress.
